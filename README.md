The use of the progam is to cut down on programing the GUI, this project contains a window which allows you to add different widgets and change properties.
In it's current state it is limited to Buttons and Labels with the only property editing only being the position and text.

- In its current state it should only be used for quick prototyping as it does not have any undo or delete functions
- There is no saving as of now so when you want to start again you need to restart everything.
