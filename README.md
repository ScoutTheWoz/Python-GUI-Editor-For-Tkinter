# Python-GUI-Editor-For-Tkinter
This project with no current name is a GUI editor for use with tkinter.
The use of the progam is to cut down on programing the GUI, this project contains a window which allows you to add different widgets and change properties.
In it's current state it is limited to Buttons, Labels and Entries with the only property editing only being the position and text.
The display shows the widgets as buttons, you can click them to destroy them but you manualy have to remove it from the code for now.

# Notes

- In its current state it should only be used for quick prototyping
- There is no saving as of now so when you want to start again you need to restart everything.
